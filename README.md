This is my submission for the week 6 API homework.

## Observable Trends:
1. The further latitude gets from 0 (either negative or positive) in either hemisphere, max temperature decreases.
- Possible explanation: Due to the Earth's curvature and axial tilt, the sun's energy is spread out over larger areas and therefore may result in lower maximum temperatures in those areas.
2. Humidity in the Southern Hemisphere seems to cluster into higher ranges in latitides closer to zero. 
- Possible explanation: Increase in temperatures in latitudes closer to zero could account for humidity increases as warm air has the ability to evaporate water at a faster rate than colder air and hold more moisture than colder air.
3. In the figure showing City Latitude vs Cloudiness, there is a lack of 0% cloudiness plot points from just under 0 degrees latitude until almost 20 latitude.
- Possible explanation: There is a relatively higher amount of cloud cover over these areas, and since almost no data points are present for 0-20% cloudiness in this area, it is realtively cloudy. Again higher temps at the equator and near the equator may account for more evaporation and water storage in the air, which may result in more cloud formation in these areas.

Things to note: Since all the data points in the dataset are land based, the oceanic componant of the weather data isn't equally involved in this dataset.
